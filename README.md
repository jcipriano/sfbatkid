To commemorate the story of Batkid, the latest initiative from the Make-a-Wish Foundation, a group of creatives produced an interactive, socially sourced comic book: TheBatkid.com
 
By using images shared through #SFBatkid, this creative team has chronicled the adventures of 5-year-old Miles, aka Batkid, a young boy who captured the hearts of millions when Make-a-Wish helped him save the city of San Francisco.
 
Each panel from TheBatkid.com comes from Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Flickr. As a result, the site crafts a collection of individual moments into a digital story for all to enjoy.
 
Visitors to TheBatkid.com are encouraged to donate to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.
